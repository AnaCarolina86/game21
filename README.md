## Cards game

This cards game is similar to [Blackjack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game. The difference is that in my game there is no dealer and you play alone, with luck at your side. There is a deck with 52 cards, and the player asks for one card each time. If the sum of the cards is 21, the player wins, if it is above 21, the player loses.

It is not finished yet, I am going to continue working in this website, I want to improve the user experience and make the layout more attractive to the user.

### How I build the game

I develop this game simply using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and my creativity.
